						<p>Hi there, we're Matt and Jaclyn Taylor and we're the team behind Oak Hill Media. We've been married close to four years now and have been dating since highschool! Matt has always been interested in cameras and got into filming in college when he was put in charge of production for a capstone project. Back in 2012 we had a film done for our own wedding and we've watched it so many times and loved it so much that we want to give that experience to others as well.</p>
						<p>So why the name Oak Hill? We both grew up in Charlotte and came up to the Raleigh Durham area for college, I went to North Carolina State and Jaclyn went to Chapel Hill. We then got married my senior year and stayed up here after we found a couple of great jobs nearby. This is the area where we've bought a home, found an <i>amazing</i> godly community, gotten involved with a great church, and have started to build our family. This area is our home now so we chose the name Oak Hill Media because Raleigh is the City of <i>Oaks</i> and Chapel <i>Hill</i> is a city that's dear to us both.</p>
						<p>If you're interested in hearing more about us and our prices please don't hesitate to shoot us an email, give us a call, or better yet let's grab some coffee!</p>

                Hi friends! We're Oak Hill Media, a husband and wife cinematography team based in Raleigh, NC. Weâ€™re
                high school sweethearts who got hitched in college and now have 2 sweet babies. Oak Hill Media got its
                start when Matt offered to film a friend's wedding "just for fun." After several shares on Facebook and
                YouTube, what was once just a hobby became a full fledged business.

                <i><b>Our Mission</b></i>
                <br />
                Our desire is to tell each couple's unique story. We believe in real, deep, meaningful marriages. Our
                aim is to capture the natural, candid, and impactful moments of your wedding day. Everything we do, we
                do to glorify our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. Our primary purpose is to make His name famous in our
                business and daily lives.

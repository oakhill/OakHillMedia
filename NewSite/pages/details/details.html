                        Matt and Jaclyn are pure joy. They delivered to us our most favorite gift to date. You know
                        that
                        you’re going to be so happy on your wedding day, watching it all come together - until it’s the
                        next day and you can’t believe how fast it all flew by. Thankfully Matt and Jaclyn so perfectly
                        captured our special day. From first touch to the sparkler send off I feel like I was able to
                        relive my most favorite day. This video I will cherish for all the years to come. I’ll be able
                        to share this video with our children one day, and hopefully their children - and not JUST a
                        video, but a witness to the great GIFT that God has given us in marriage. WE ARE OVER THE MOON!
                        Thank you both for caring so much about what you do it radiates off you both and made being so
                        happy so easy! <br />

                        Every time I watch our video it brings tears of joy to my eyes. There is nothing I would change
                        about it. They did amazing job and were so easy to work with. From emails, meeting to go over
                        things for the video for our big day, the wedding day, to us receiving our video the
                        communication was on point. Never had to worry about anything when it came to our video. They
                        got every little detail that was important to us and more. It so worth it to invest in a
                        videographer for your wedding day. Your wedding day happens so fast and you can't be in all the
                        places, so to have the video and see your wedding being set up, your groom getting ready, guest
                        arriving, your first look and so much more is breath taking. It was a great pleasure to have
                        Matt and Jaclyn be apart of our special day. Thank you from the bottom of our heats.

                        Matt and Jaclyn create a finished product that is perfect in every way! They are a joy to work
                        with and really want you to be thrilled with your wedding day video. Their attention to detail
                        is outstanding and they tend to capture every element of your day without your even noticing
                        they are filming! We love our video and are so happy we chose them to help us capture our
                        special day!
